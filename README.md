## What I've been working on
### Shooter
A React web app aimed at helping players develop a consistant jumpshot 🏀

Utilizing tensorflow's posenet to identify body positioning, an analysis of a basketball players form can take place, providing the ability to give the user statistical results in order to help improve their jumpshot form thus scoring potential.
